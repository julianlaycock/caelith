## Verbal Disclaimers for Presenter

1. **Opening:** "Caelith is a compliance support and documentation tool. It does not replace legal counsel or constitute legal advice."
2. **Copilot:** "The AI copilot provides informational guidance — explicitly not legal advice. Your team always makes the final decisions."
3. **Integrity chain:** "The hash chain provides tamper-evidence — if any record is modified, verification will flag it."
4. **Pricing:** "We are in our pilot phase. Pricing is indicative. We offer a complimentary 90-day evaluation."
5. **Regulations:** "Regulatory citations are drawn from primary source legislation. As with any tool, confirm citations are current before relying on them."

Caelith — AIFMD II Compliance Engine

PROBLEM:
4,000+ EU alternative investment fund managers must comply with AIFMD II by April 16, 2026. Today, investor eligibility checks are performed manually using spreadsheets, creating regulatory risk: no audit trail, no version control, no evidence for examinations.

SOLUTION:
Caelith is a SaaS compliance engine that automates investor eligibility checking and generates tamper-evident decision records. Each decision captures the exact inputs, rules, and result with a SHA-256 integrity chain — creating verifiable audit trails for regulatory examinations.

MARKET:
- 4,200+ registered AIFMs in Luxembourg alone
- 500+ KVGs in Germany (KAGB-regulated)
- Current solutions: spreadsheets (free but risky) or enterprise tools like eFront (€50K-500K/year)
- Caelith targets the underserved middle: €800-1,500/month

TRACTION:
- Fully functional product (built Feb 2026)
- 13 eligibility rules covering KAGB, CSSF, CBI frameworks
- 28 database tables, 21 API endpoint groups, AI compliance copilot
- Seeking 3-5 German KVG pilot partners (free 3-month pilots)

TEAM:
Julian Laycock — Founder, Full-stack engineer, HWR Berlin student
Deep domain expertise in AIFMD, KAGB, CSSF regulations

USE OF FUNDS (EXIST):
- €3,000/month founder stipend (18 months)
- Hire compliance domain expert (part-time consultant)
- Cloud infrastructure (hosting, API costs)
- Travel to Luxembourg for ALFI events and Big Four meetings

TIMELINE:
- Feb-Mar 2026: German KVG pilot acquisition (3-5 partners)
- Apr 2026: AIFMD II deadline — free pilots convert to paid
- Q3 2026: Expand to Luxembourg, hire first employee
- Q4 2026: Target €100K ARR (6-8 paying customers)
```

Subject: RegTech for AIFMD II — application to LHoFT

Dear LHoFT Team,

I'm Julian Laycock, founder of Caelith — a compliance engine for AIFMD II that automates investor eligibility checking and generates tamper-evident decision records for alternative investment fund managers.

We're particularly interested in LHoFT because Luxembourg is our primary target market: 4,200 registered AIFMs, 15,000 regulated funds, and a pressing AIFMD II transposition deadline on April 16.

Caelith is fully functional — built and tested, with 13 eligibility rules covering CSSF, KAGB, and CBI frameworks. We're currently running free pilots with German KVGs and plan to expand to Luxembourg in Q2 2026.

We believe LHoFT's ecosystem — connections to fund managers, administrators, the Big Four, and the CSSF — would be invaluable for our go-to-market. In return, we bring a working product that addresses a concrete regulatory pain point for your member firms.

I'd welcome the opportunity to discuss how Caelith fits within LHoFT's programs. Happy to demo the product at your convenience.

Best regards,
Julian Laycock
Founder, Caelith

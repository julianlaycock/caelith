# TARGET COMPANY IDENTIFICATION — German KVGs
**How to build a prospect list of 50+ qualified targets**

---

## STEP 1: BaFin KVG Registry (Primary Source)

BaFin maintains a public database of all registered Kapitalverwaltungsgesellschaften.

**URL:** https://portal.mvp.bafin.de/database/InstInfo/

**How to search:**
1. Go to the BaFin Institute Database
2. Under "Institutsart" (Institution type), select "Kapitalverwaltungsgesellschaft"
3. Filter by status: "Aktiv" (Active)
4. This gives you the complete list of licensed KVGs in Germany

**What you get:** Company name, BaFin ID, address, status, license type

**What to do with it:**
- Export/copy the list
- Cross-reference each KVG on LinkedIn to find compliance contacts
- Prioritize KVGs with <€500M AUM (they're our segment)
- Skip the obvious giants (DWS, Union Investment, Deka) — they have enterprise solutions

---

## STEP 2: BAI Member Directory

The **Bundesverband Alternative Investments e.V.** (BAI) is the German industry association for alternative investments.

**URL:** https://www.bvai.de (also known as BAI)

**Why it matters:**
- BAI members are specifically ALTERNATIVE investment managers — our exact target
- Members include KVGs, fund administrators, service providers, and institutional investors
- The member directory is a curated list of firms that care about alternative investments

**How to use:**
1. Check the BAI website for their member directory
2. Look for KVG members specifically
3. Cross-reference with BaFin registry
4. These firms are more likely to need AIFMD II compliance tools

**BAI events to attend/monitor:**
- BAI Alternative Investor Conference (annual, usually Frankfurt)
- BAI webinars on regulatory topics
- Check their events page for AIFMD II-specific sessions

## STEP 3: LinkedIn Sales Navigator Search

If you have LinkedIn Sales Navigator (€80/month — worth it for 2 months):

### Search 1: Decision Makers
```
Title: "Head of Compliance" OR "Compliance Officer" OR "Chief Compliance Officer" OR "Leiter Compliance"
Industry: Financial Services OR Investment Management
Company headcount: 11-200
Location: Germany
Keywords: KVG OR Kapitalverwaltungsgesellschaft OR AIFM OR "alternative investment"
```

### Search 2: Champions (the people who do daily compliance work)
```
Title: "Compliance Manager" OR "Compliance Analyst" OR "Regulatory Affairs" OR "Compliance Specialist"
Industry: Financial Services
Location: Germany
Keywords: KAGB OR AIFMD OR KVG OR "alternative investment"
```

### Search 3: Companies directly
```
Company search:
Industry: Investment Management
Headcount: 11-200
Location: Germany
Keywords: KVG OR "alternative" OR "private equity" OR "real estate fund" OR "infrastructure fund"
```

**If you don't have Sales Navigator:**
- Use regular LinkedIn search with the same terms
- You get fewer results but it's free
- Focus on 2nd-degree connections (ask for introductions)

## STEP 4: Fund Databases

### Scope Explorer / Scope Funds
- German fund rating and analysis platform
- Lists German-domiciled funds with their KVG
- Can identify smaller KVGs managing alternative funds
- URL: https://www.scopeexplorer.com

### BVI (Bundesverband Investment und Asset Management)
- German investment fund industry association (broader than BAI)
- Member directory includes KVGs
- URL: https://www.bvi.de
- Their statistics reports show market size and players

### Preqin / PitchBook
- Expensive ($$$) but comprehensive databases of alternative fund managers
- Many offer free trials or limited access
- Good for identifying AUM sizes and fund strategies

---

## STEP 5: AIFMD II Events (Feb-Apr 2026)

Search for and attend these types of events:

### Where to look:
- **BAI events page** — they regularly host regulatory webinars
- **BaFin events** — BaFin sometimes hosts information sessions for regulated firms
- **IIR / Euroforum** — German conference organizers frequently run KAGB/AIFMD events
- **LinkedIn Events** — Search "AIFMD II" or "KAGB 2026" in LinkedIn Events
- **Eventbrite** — Search "AIFMD" or "fund compliance" in Germany

### What to do at events:
- Don't pitch from stage. Listen, take notes, talk to people during breaks.
- Ask: "How are you handling eligibility documentation for AIFMD II?"
- Collect business cards / LinkedIn connections
- Follow up within 24 hours with a personalized note

---

## STEP 6: Direct Competitors' Customers

### Who uses spreadsheets (our replaceable target):
- Small KVGs with <5 funds and <€200M AUM
- Firms that don't appear in any software vendor's case studies
- Firms whose compliance team is 1-2 people

### Who uses eFront/Investran (our upgrade target):
- Mid-market KVGs unhappy with cost or complexity
- Search LinkedIn for posts complaining about compliance tools
- Check eFront customer lists / case studies for mid-market names

- AUM: €50-300M
- Funds: 1-5
- Team: 5-20 people

### Category B: Small PE/VC KVGs
- AUM: €100-500M
- Funds: 3-10
- Team: 10-30 people
- Compliance: 1-3 people
- **Why good:** Higher AUM = higher willingness to pay

### Category C: Service-KVGs / Fund Administrators
- Service multiple external fund initiators
- Higher leverage per deal (onboard once, serve many funds)
- Longer sales cycle but higher LTV
- **Why strategic:** One deal = multiple fund structures = higher MRR

## QUALIFICATION CRITERIA

Before spending time on a prospect, check:

1. **Are they a KVG?** (Not just an investment firm — they need to be KAGB-regulated)
2. **Do they manage alternative funds?** (Not just UCITS — we're AIFMD-focused)
3. **Are they small-to-mid?** (<€500M AUM, <30 people)
4. **Can you find a compliance contact?** (If not, try the Managing Director)
5. **Are they independent?** (Not a subsidiary of a large bank — those have enterprise solutions)

If 4/5 are yes, add to list and reach out.

## WEEKLY OUTREACH TARGETS

| Week | LinkedIn Connections | Cold Emails | Follow-ups | Demo Calls |
|------|---------------------|-------------|------------|------------|
| 1 (Feb 17-23) | 20 | 10 | 0 | 0-1 |
| 2 (Feb 24-28) | 15 | 10 | 10 | 2-4 |
| 3 (Mar 3-7) | 15 | 10 | 15 | 3-5 |
| 4 (Mar 10-14) | 10 | 10 | 15 | 3-5 |

**Conversion expectations (realistic):**
- LinkedIn connection acceptance rate: 20-30%
- DM to demo conversion: 10-15%
- Cold email response rate: 5-10%
- Email to demo conversion: 15-20%
- Demo to pilot conversion: 25-40%

**With 20 connections + 10 emails in week 1:**
- ~6 LinkedIn accepts → ~1 demo
- ~1 email response → ~0.2 demos
- Total week 1: ~1 demo call

**Cumulative by week 4:**
- ~50 total outreach touchpoints that convert to conversations
- ~8-12 demo calls completed
- ~2-4 pilot agreements signed

This is realistic for founder-led, cold outreach in B2B RegTech. Don't expect faster. Do expect quality over quantity.

## 1. LINKEDIN PROFILE (Update First)

### Headline (max 220 chars)
```
Founder @ Caelith — AIFMD II Compliance Engine for Alternative Investment Funds | Automated Eligibility Checks + Regulator-Ready Audit Trails | HWR Berlin
```

### About Section
```
I'm building Caelith because compliance officers at alternative investment funds shouldn't have to prove their eligibility decisions with spreadsheets.

AIFMD II transposes on April 16, 2026. When BaFin, CSSF, or the CBI examines your fund, they'll ask: "Show me how you determined this investor was eligible." If the answer is "we checked a spreadsheet," that's a problem.

Caelith is a compliance engine that:
→ Runs deterministic eligibility checks against KAGB, CSSF, and CBI rules
→ Creates tamper-evident decision records with SHA-256 integrity chains
→ Generates PDF evidence bundles ready for regulatory examination
→ Models "what-if" scenarios when rules change

We're offering free 3-month pilots to German KVGs preparing for AIFMD II.

If you're responsible for investor eligibility at a KVG or fund administrator, I'd love to show you what we've built. 15 minutes, no pitch, just a live demo.

## 3. LINKEDIN FOLLOW-UP DM (after connection accepted)

### Version A — Demo invite
```
Thanks for connecting, [First Name].

Quick question — how is [Company] handling AIFMD II investor eligibility documentation right now?

We built Caelith specifically for this. It runs deterministic eligibility checks against KAGB/CSSF rules and generates SHA-256 sealed decision records that hold up in regulatory examinations.

Takes 15 minutes to see it live with a realistic fund structure. Would [Tuesday] or [Thursday] work for a quick demo?

Julian
```

### Version B — Content-first (if they seem cautious)
```
Thanks for connecting, [First Name].

I've been researching how mid-market KVGs are approaching the April 16 AIFMD II deadline. The biggest gap I keep hearing about: documenting eligibility decisions in a way that satisfies BaFin.

We built a tool that generates tamper-evident decision records — essentially version control for compliance decisions. Happy to share a 2-minute walkthrough video if that's easier than a call.

## 4. COLD EMAILS

### Email 1 — First touch
```
Subject: AIFMD II in [X] days — is [Company] ready?

Hi [First Name],

April 16 is [X] days away. Most KVGs I'm talking to are still running investor eligibility checks in spreadsheets — which won't hold up when BaFin asks for documentation.

I built Caelith to fix this. It's a compliance engine that:

• Runs automated eligibility checks (KAGB §1 Abs. 19 Nr. 33, CSSF Circ. 06/241)
• Produces tamper-evident decision records with SHA-256 integrity chains
• Generates PDF evidence bundles for regulatory examinations
• Models impact when eligibility criteria change

We're offering free 3-month pilots to the first 5 German KVGs. No commitment, no credit card — just a chance to get compliant before the deadline.

Would you have 15 minutes this week for a quick demo?

Best,

### Email 2 — Follow-up (5 business days later, no response)
```
Subject: Re: AIFMD II in [X] days — quick question

Hi [First Name],

Following up on my note about AIFMD II readiness.

One thing I keep hearing from compliance teams: the hardest part isn't knowing the rules — it's proving you followed them correctly when the regulator asks.

Caelith creates an immutable decision record for every eligibility check, with the exact rules and investor data that applied at that moment. Think of it as version control for compliance decisions.

Here's what a 15-minute demo covers:
1. Set up your fund structure (SICAV, SIF, RAIF, Spezial-AIF)
2. Run an eligibility check against KAGB/CSSF rules
3. See the sealed decision record with integrity hash
4. Download the PDF evidence bundle

Happy to show you. Here's my calendar: [Calendly link]

### Email 3 — Final follow-up (5 business days later)
```
Subject: Re: AIFMD II compliance — last note

Hi [First Name],

I'll keep this short. Two things:

1. We just released scenario modeling — you can simulate "what if we change the minimum investment from €200K to €125K" and instantly see which existing investors would be affected.

2. The free pilot offer closes March 15 (we can only support 5 concurrently).

If the timing isn't right, no worries at all. But if AIFMD II documentation is on your radar, 15 minutes could save your team significant effort.

## 5. LINKEDIN ARTICLE / POST (Publish week of Feb 17)

### Post 1 — Awareness (short post, ~150 words)
```
58 days until AIFMD II transposes into national law.

Here's what I keep hearing from compliance teams at German KVGs:

"We know the rules. We just can't prove we followed them."

The problem isn't eligibility logic — most compliance officers know whether an investor qualifies as semi-professional under KAGB §1 Abs. 19 Nr. 33.

The problem is documentation.

When BaFin examines your fund 18 months from now, they won't ask "did you check eligibility?" They'll ask "show me the decision record."

If your answer is a spreadsheet with a date stamp, that's a risk.

We built Caelith to solve exactly this: deterministic eligibility checks → tamper-evident decision records → PDF evidence bundles.

Free 3-month pilots open for German KVGs.

DM me or: julian@caelith.tech

```

### Post 2 — Technical credibility (for week 2)
```
How do you prove a compliance decision wasn't altered after the fact?

We solved this with a SHA-256 hash chain.

Every eligibility decision in Caelith captures:
→ The investor's data at the moment of the check
→ The exact eligibility rules that applied
→ The computed result (eligible/ineligible + reasons)
→ A cryptographic hash linking it to every previous decision

Change one byte of any historical record, and the entire chain breaks. Verifiable in seconds.

This is what "decision provenance" means in practice. Not just logging that a decision happened — proving what inputs and rules produced it, and proving it hasn't been tampered with since.

This is what regulators actually want to see.

We're looking for 5 German KVGs to pilot this before AIFMD II goes live on April 16.

## 8. RESPONSE TEMPLATES

### When someone says "Sounds interesting, tell me more"
```
Great to hear, [First Name]. Rather than a long email, let me show you live — it's much more convincing to see the eligibility check run in real time.

I have slots [day] at [time] and [day] at [time]. Which works better?

The demo takes 15 minutes:
1. I set up a fund structure matching your setup
2. We run an eligibility check for a sample investor
3. You see the sealed decision record and evidence bundle

No prep needed on your end.

Julian
```

### When someone says "We already have a solution"
```
Good to hear you're ahead of the curve, [First Name]. Mind if I ask what you're using?

The gap we keep seeing — even with existing tools — is decision provenance: being able to show BaFin the exact rules and data that produced each eligibility decision, with cryptographic proof it hasn't been altered.

If that's already covered in your current setup, you're in great shape. If not, it might be worth a quick comparison. Either way, I'm happy to chat.

Julian
```

### When someone says "Not the right time"
```
Completely understand, [First Name]. I'll follow up closer to the deadline in case timing changes.

One quick thought: we're seeing that KVGs who start now can have their full investor base validated in under a week. Starting in March gets progressively harder.

No pressure — I'll circle back in 3 weeks. In the meantime, feel free to reach out if anything changes.

Julian
```

### When someone says "Send me more information"
```
Of course. Here's a quick overview:

Caelith is a compliance engine purpose-built for AIFMD II. Core capabilities:

1. Deterministic eligibility checking — 13 validation rules covering KAGB, CSSF, CBI requirements
2. Decision provenance — every check produces a tamper-evident record with SHA-256 integrity chain
3. Evidence bundles — downloadable PDF with decision details, regulatory citations, and integrity proof
4. Scenario modeling — simulate "what if" changes to eligibility criteria
5. AI compliance copilot — ask questions about AIFMD regulations, get answers with regulatory citations

Pricing: €800-1,500/month per fund structure (vs. €50K+/year for enterprise tools like eFront).

We're offering free 3-month pilots for German KVGs. Want to see it live? 15 minutes: [Calendly link]

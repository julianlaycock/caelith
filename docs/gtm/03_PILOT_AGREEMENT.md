## Caelith Pilot Program Agreement

**Between:** Caelith (Julian Laycock, Einzelunternehmer, Berlin, Germany)
**And:** [Company Name] ("[Pilot Partner]")
**Effective Date:** [Date]
**Pilot Duration:** 90 days from Effective Date

---

### 1. Scope

Caelith grants the Pilot Partner complimentary access to the Caelith AIFMD II compliance platform for evaluation purposes. This includes:

- Full platform access (eligibility checking, decision provenance, scenario modeling, compliance copilot)
- Up to **[10] fund structures** and **[500] investor records**
- Onboarding support (data import assistance, configuration, training)
- Direct support channel (email + Slack/Teams)

### 2. Data Handling

- All Pilot Partner data is stored in a **dedicated, isolated database tenant** within the EU (Germany)
- Caelith will **not** share, sell, or use Pilot Partner data for any purpose other than providing the service
- Pilot Partner data will be **encrypted at rest and in transit**
- Upon pilot termination, Pilot Partner may request **full data export** (JSON/CSV) and **permanent deletion** of their data within 30 days
- Caelith acts as a **data processor** under GDPR; a Data Processing Agreement (DPA) is available upon request

### 3. What the Pilot Partner Provides

- A designated point of contact for feedback and testing
- At least **one realistic fund structure** with investor data for testing (anonymized data is acceptable)
- **30 minutes per week** for feedback calls during the pilot period
- Honest feedback on product utility, usability, and gaps

### 4. What Caelith Provides

- Platform access at no cost for the full 90-day pilot period
- Personalized onboarding (data import, eligibility criteria configuration, rules setup)
- Response to support requests within **1 business day**
- All product updates and new features released during the pilot period

### 5. Success Metrics

The pilot will be considered successful if:

- [ ] Pilot Partner can run eligibility checks on their fund/investor data
- [ ] Decision records accurately reflect applicable regulations (KAGB, CSSF, etc.)
- [ ] Evidence bundle PDFs meet the Pilot Partner's documentation standards
- [ ] Platform delivers measurable time savings vs. current process

### 6. After the Pilot

- **No automatic conversion.** The Pilot Partner is under no obligation to purchase after the pilot.
- If the Pilot Partner wishes to continue, Caelith will offer a commercial subscription at the then-current pricing (currently €800–1,500/month per fund structure).
- If the Pilot Partner does not wish to continue, all data will be exported and deleted per Section 2.

### 7. Limitations

- The Caelith platform is a **compliance support tool**, not legal advice. All eligibility decisions should be reviewed by qualified compliance personnel.
- Caelith does not guarantee regulatory compliance outcomes. The platform assists with documentation and validation, but regulatory responsibility remains with the Pilot Partner.
- Caelith is provided "as is" during the pilot period. Uptime SLAs apply only to paid subscriptions.

### 8. Confidentiality

Both parties agree to keep the other's confidential information (including but not limited to investor data, product features, and business terms) confidential for 2 years after pilot termination.

### 9. Termination

Either party may terminate this agreement at any time with 7 days' written notice (email is sufficient). Upon termination, Section 2 (Data Handling) applies.

## USAGE NOTES

1. **Send as PDF.** Convert this markdown to PDF (or use the HTML version). A 1-page PDF attachment feels more professional than a Google Doc link.

2. **Don't negotiate terms.** If they want changes, accommodate them. The goal is to get them using the product, not to win a legal negotiation.

3. **The DPA mention is intentional.** Compliance officers will ask about GDPR. Having it mentioned proactively builds trust.

4. **"Einzelunternehmer" is fine for now.** You can formalize to GmbH later. Don't let legal entity setup delay customer acquisition.

5. **Anonymized data is acceptable.** Some KVGs won't share real investor data in a pilot. That's fine — anonymized data with realistic characteristics still demonstrates value.

Deploy my Caelith backend to Railway. The frontend is already live at www.caelith.tech but the backend API is missing, causing "Failed to fetch" errors.

PROJECT: C:\Users\julia\projects\private-asset-registry_Caelith_v2
GITHUB REPO: julianlaycock/caelith (main branch)

RAILWAY ACCOUNT:
- Email: julianlaycock94@gmail.com
- Password: Gapesalu46020@
- Existing project has frontend deployed at f1xc8s3n.up.railway.app

TASK:
1. Add PostgreSQL database to Railway project
2. Deploy backend service from GitHub with:
   - Build: npm run build:backend
   - Start: npm run start:backend
3. Set backend environment variables:
   - NODE_ENV=production
   - PORT=3001
   - JWT_SECRET=change-this-in-production-min-32-chars-long
   - CORS_ORIGINS=https://www.caelith.tech,https://f1xc8s3n.up.railway.app
   - DATABASE_URL=(from PostgreSQL service)
   - ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=(read from .env file in project directory)
   - OPENAI_API_KEY=(read from .env file in project directory)
4. Update frontend service variables with backend URL:
   - BACKEND_API_REWRITE_TARGET=https://<backend-url>/api
   - NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=/api
5. Redeploy frontend

TEST: Login should work at www.caelith.tech/login with admin@caelith.com / Admin1234

The backend code is already fixed, built, and pushed to GitHub. Just needs deployment.
